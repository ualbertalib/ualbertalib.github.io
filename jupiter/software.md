# Development
## Code Management
The project will have a roadmap with dated milestones and releases, listing implemented features for each release. In github, issues will be tied to epics, which will be associated with milestones mapped to a release roadmap. We require clearly defined epics with clear scope, definition, and standard epic elements. Each epic will require:
* Description (Scope and out of scope; Clear definition of done)
* Rough description of resources needed (dev, metadata, sysadmin time for deployment)
* Architecture diagram (high level) 
* Project sprintboard (Zenhub or Github Projects board)
* Workflow description for UX
* Prototypes or wireframes for UI
* Implementation details 
* Deployment details
* Potential features/out of scope
Scrum-masters will need to adhere to the template defined, and complete related activities to keep the issues, boards and documentation up-to-date. 

### Code Review
### Unit/Integration/Performance Testing
### Proper Deployment and Production Monitoring
## Continuous Integration
Our desired workflow of rapid development, testing, user testing, and revision requires a CI environment. We will also require a more clearly and properly defined staging environment and sufficient error tracking and analysis for robust production testing and monitoring. 
### Release & Feature Documentation
## Rails
The project will use standard Rails conventions and will resist custom Rails implementations. This is necessary to ensure for effective onboarding, more sustainable future data migrations, and to reduce/mitigate technical debt inside the project. As with accessibility, if we deviate from standard Rails conversions, we will have a justified reason for doing so and the decision will be clearly documented and approved.

#### What is the Relationship to Samvera Community
We are Samvera partners and will participate in and review community efforts in domains that relate to our implementation. For example, the Analytics Working Group is defining common use cases and principles for repository analytics, and this is likely to be helpful to us. We will be sharing our work on Jupiter as an implementation of Samvera components (and our code) with the community, emphasizing the philosophy and principles of our work and how this helps us meet our service, program and development goals as well as our timelines.
