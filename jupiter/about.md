# Project Principles
## UI/UX
User experience is at the centre of our design and development work. We will clearly articulate our design principles guided by industry standards and best practices and will implement a new development and testing process that incorporates evidence from users, including in-person user evaluation and feedback and analysis of analytics and other quantitative measures. Our design decisions will be based on defined user requirements and will be clearly documented in the feature backlog prior to development work beginning.
## Accessibility
We commit to [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/) 2.0 level A compliance for this application. We will also conduct an accessibility spike to investigate the requirements of the WCAG AA standard. Ontario accessibility legislation requires AA compliance for publicly-funded institutions, and it is unlikely national legislation will differ markedly from this requirement. If we make a design decision that is not compliant with [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/) 2.0 level A, there must be strong documented rationale for that decision and the Product Owner will have approved it. 
Proper setup for internationalization of the application should also included in the design and development of the application, to ensure it will work well for (or ca
## Code Management
The project will have a roadmap with dated milestones and releases, listing implemented features for each release. In github, issues will be tied to epics, which will be associated with milestones mapped to a release roadmap. We require clearly defined epics with clear scope, definition, and standard epic elements. Each epic will require:
* Description (Scope and out of scope; Clear definition of done)
* Rough description of resources needed (dev, metadata, sysadmin time for deployment)
* Architecture diagram (high level) 
* Project sprintboard (Zenhub or Github Projects board)
* Workflow description for UX
* Prototypes or wireframes for UI
* Implementation details 
* Deployment details
* Potential features/out of scope
Scrum-masters will need to adhere to the template defined, and complete related activities to keep the issues, boards and documentation up-to-date.
