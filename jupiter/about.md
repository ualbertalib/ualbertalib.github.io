## Design and Development Workflow

## UX/UI
User experience is at the centre of our design and development work. Our design decisions are based on defined user requirements that are clearly documented in the feature backlog prior to development work beginning. The following are used in our UX informed design process:

## Accessibility
We commit to <a href= "https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/" target="_blank">WCAG 2.0 Level A</a> compliance for this application. Proper setup for internationalization of the application is also accounted for in the development of the application, to ensure it will work well for (or can be easily adapted for) users from any region or language as the need arises. A <a href= "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tYmw3mn7vDEuI8uFMtXrTX3-SyB40II6OhQgHXH4O2I/edit?usp=sharing"target="_blank">Web Accessibility Design Checklist</a> was developed to embed accessibility in our design processes.

## Data Model
The Jupiter data model plays a critical role in our organizationâ€™s ability to create repositories and DAMS that organize data in an interoperable way, thus establishing a common understanding of how digital objects are conceived and represented across repositories, making it easier to support object migration unrestricted by application domain profiles, and creating a framework of consistent data structure for APIs.
## Metadata
Discovery and access (e.g., searching, browsing, faceting, visualization) are driven by good metadata. Good metadata is defined as being sufficient to meet the needs of users and stakeholders. We will always strive for good metadata.
Metadata in the project will be driven by UX work and service needs identified by the Product Owner and stakeholders. 
Linked data is a set of best practices for exposing, sharing, and connecting pieces of data on the web in support of more sophisticated use of that data.The application (as defined above) is linked data ready and we will explore the potential for leveraging linked data principles in support of good metadata.
